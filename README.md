### What I learned
Now, i can properly center a div with no hassle, thanks to this project, you Tube and this article on [medium](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/5-ways-i-would-center-a-div-why-the-last-is-my-favorite-c1c54b44ac58)

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Figtree';
  src: url('assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Figtree';
  src: url('assets/fonts/Figtree-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

### Continued development

While working on this project, i was struggling with media query. It took me more hours to make it responsive on the smaller mobile devices than completing the project itself. I definitely have to dive more on media query, make research and become proficient in implementing it.
